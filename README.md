# Fungal communities across a surface water permanence gradient in a non-perennial prairie stream network.
### Bioinformatics and Data analysis
This repository contains code for replicating an analysis of fungal communities collected from an intermittent stream network, associated with a manuscript (Bond et al. In Review). 

This research was conducted as part of the AIMS Project (Aquatic Intermittency effects on Microbiomes in Streams), supported by an NSF EPSCoR Track II Grant # OIA 2019603

This pipeline is composed of two main components: 
1) Bioinformatics / processing of amplicon sequences to prouce ASVs following the DADA2 pipeline.
2) Analysis of fungal communities with environmental data.
We also include code for generating maps and calculating some environmental parameters from previously published environmental datasets.

#### Working data
For ease of use, in the phyloseq_tabs folder, I have included a compressed file (fall2023.zip) containing the combined metadata table with all processed environmental data used, along with ASV counts and taxonomy used in the data analysis R markdown document. 


### Outputs
I have posted knitted documents of the current versions of the bioinformatics pipeline (Appendix S1) and data analysis (Appendix S2) on Rpubs for reference.
